Creating a Password-Protected ZIP Archive:

    Create Your Files: Prepare the files you want to include in the ZIP archive. Ensure they are in the same directory as your terminal session.

    Open a Terminal: Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.

    Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory containing your files.

    Create the ZIP Archive: Use the zip command to create a password-protected ZIP archive. Replace archive_name.zip with the desired name for your archive, and replace file1, file2, file3, etc., with the names of the files you want to include:

    bash

    zip -e archive_name.zip file1 file2 file3

    You will be prompted to enter and verify a password for the archive.

Executing the Password-Cracking Script:

    Save the Script: Save the Python script (e.g., improved_zipbrute.py) to a directory of your choice.

    Open a Terminal: Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.

    Navigate to the Script's Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.

    Run the Script: Execute the script using Python in the following format, replacing target.zip with the path to the ZIP archive you created and passwords.txt with the path to a text file containing potential passwords:

    bash

    python3 improved_zipbrute.py -z target.zip -p passwords.txt

    The script will start running, attempting to crack the password for the ZIP archive. If successful, it will display the found password; otherwise, it will notify you that the password was not found.

Remember to use this script responsibly and only on systems and files for which you have explicit permission to test or access. Unauthorized use of password-cracking tools can have legal and ethical consequences.
